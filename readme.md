## Provides a way of muting the Call of Duty (WarZone) PC process with one key press.

As a PC player, I play with some friends at COD WarZone.
Beeing connected to Discord with some friend, I find that the sound when you are at the training before a game is too loud because everyone shoots.
So I needed a quick way of disabling the sound from Call Of Duty witouht going back on the desktop so that I could hear my friends and speak clearly.

This hooks to the 'Â²' key and disables the soud from COD, then If pressed again, enables the sound again. The key can be changed of course.
